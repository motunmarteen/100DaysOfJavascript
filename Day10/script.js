/*
Breakdown:
switch (expression): Begins the switch statement. expression is evaluated, and its value is compared against different cases.

case value1: Each case represents a possible value that expression might match. If expression matches value1, the code block associated with value1 will be executed.

break;: It's crucial! After executing the code block for a matching case, break is used to exit the switch statement. Without break, JavaScript will continue executing code in subsequent cases even if their values donâ€™t match, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

default: (optional): This is the default case that executes when no case matches the expression. It's similar to the else statement in if-else constructs.
