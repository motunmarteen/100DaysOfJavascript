// Basic Math Operators

// false means 0 or no

alert(21 > 23)
// This will alert false because 21 is not greater than 23

alert(21 < 23)
// This will alert true because 21 is less than 23

alert(21 == 23)
// This will alert false because 21 is not equal to 23

alert(21 != 23)
// This will alert true because 21 is not equal to 23

// This can also be used for strings. Eg below:
alert("Z" > "A")
// This will alert true because Z is bigger than A

alert("Glow" > "Glee")
// This will alert true because Glow comes later than Glee in the dictionary

alert("Apple" > "Glee")
// This will alert false because Apple comes before Glee in the dictionary

alert("2" > 1)
// This will alert true because Javascript has a smart function that will help us check if the string has a number in it first. If yes, the number will then be used to compare the other number to know if it is true or false.


alert(true == 1)
// true means 1 or yes so therefore, this will return true

alert(false == 0)
// false means 0 or no so therefore, this will return true

// Note that if we use the "strict equality sign (===)", the response will be false because javascript will strictly check the compared data to be strictly the same not just when they mean the same.
