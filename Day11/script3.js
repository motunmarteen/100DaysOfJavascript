// ASSIGNMENT 3

/*
For each loop write down which values it is going to show. Then compare with the answer.
Both loops alert same values or not?
The postfix form:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
The prefix form:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );
*/ 

// SOLUTION 3

/* 
In this scenario, both loops will alert the same values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The behavior is identical for both prefix and postfix forms since the alert is executed after the increment operation in both cases.
