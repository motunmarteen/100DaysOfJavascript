    <h1>Algorithm and flowchart to check whether a given year is a leap year or not</h1>
    <h2>Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.</h2>
    <p>There are 365 days in a year. A leap year is a year that has 366 days, instead of 365 days. Hence, a leap year has one day extra and occurs every four years. We can check whether a given year is a leap year or not with the following logic. We usually think that a leap year will be divisible by 4, but apart from this, there are other conditions to do this checking. A year will be a leap year only if:</p>
<ol>
    <li>It is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100</li>
    <li>It is divisible by 400</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Let us consider an example:
    2020/4 = 505.
    Therefore, 2020 is a leap year.
</p>

<p>
    2000/100 = 20, 2000/400 = 5 and 2000/4 = 500.
    Therefore, 2000 is a leap year
</p>.

<p>
    2022/4 = 505.5
    Therefore, 2022 is not a leap year.
</p>

<p>Let us have a look at the algorithm and flowchart to check whether a given year is a leap year or not.</p>

<h2>Algorithm to check whether a given year is a leap year or not:
</h2>
<code>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Start</li>
        <li>Step 2: Read the value of the year to be checked from the user</li>
        <li>Step 3: Assign the value to a variable, say ‘year’</li>
        <li>Step 4: If (year%4 = 0 AND year%100 != 0) OR year%400 = 0, then:</li>
            <span>Step 4.1: Display “Leap Year”</span>
        <li>Step 5: Else</li>
            <span>Step 5.1: Display “Not Leap Year”</span>
        <li>Step 6: Stop</li>
    </ol>
